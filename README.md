##Goal:
In this game, the computer chooses 4 pegs each with one of 6 colors.  The playerâ€™s job is then to guess the colors that the computer has chosen in the proper order. After each guess by the player, the computer will then give two numbers as feedback.  The first number is how many pegs are the proper color and in the proper position. The second number is how many pegs are the proper color, but not in the correct position.
